    "### Unsupervised learning to define Southern Ocean sectors\n",
    "- The niche model will not use the traditional front definitions to group data\n",
    "- Instead, we will use temp + salinity + other bio factors to make custom clusters with unsupervised machine learning\n",
    "- Based off the work in [this](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014629) paper by Dan Jones in 2019\n",
    "- Fronts are difficult to define as a fixed boundary which is why a more open clustering system seems more representitive"
