Hi James,

Yes, the samples were acidified prior to analysis.

Cheers,

Dear Dr. Jason Graff,
 
I know Kristen Reifel is no longer based at your lab, she left you as a contact for the data collected by 
Oregon University on the Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise 22 (AMT22). I was wondering if you might 
be able to help with a question I have on the methodology used for the POC and PON data collected? 
There is no mention on whether acidification was used or not and I was wondering if you might know 
the answer?
 
Kind regards
