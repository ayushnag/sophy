METHODS AND NOTES,,,,,,
Water samples collected from the ship's intake (~5m depth) by filling up 2L bottles (round-robbin style),,,,,,
*Blank cells indicate no available data,,,,,,
,,,,,,
POC and PON samples,,,(particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen),,,
Filtered 3 volumes (actual volumes differed between samples) onto precombusted GF/F filters,,,,,,
Filters wrapped in foil and frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis,,,,,,
Measured for nitrogen and carbon using an Exeter Analytical Model 440 CHN/O/S Elemental Analyzer in the Behrenfeld lab using standard methods,,,,,,
,created linear regression of C or N concentration versus volume filtered,,,,,
,used the corresponding filter blank for each sample,,,,,
,"subtracted intercept blank from C or N value, then divided by volume, then averaged the three measurements",,,,,
,NOTE: measurements with R^2<0.9 were removed,,,,,
units = ug/L,,,,,,
*Got new POC values from Jason Graff (Behrenfeld lab) using his blank method,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Phytoplankton samples,,,,,,
Live phytoplankton cells were identified and counted immediately using a BD Biosciences Influx flow cytometer (model 104S),,,,,,
Flow cytometer was equipped with the Forward Scatter Small Particle Option,,,,,,
Particles excited with a blue (488 nm) laser,,,,,,
Used Chlorophyll (692 nm) fluorescence as the trigger parameter,,,,,,
Synechococcus identified by high phycoerythryn fluorescence (530 nm),,,,,,
Other taxa based on chlorophyll (692 nm) fluorescence and scatter,,,,,,
Calculated phytoplankton concentrations using a time-volume calibration and time it took to record each file,,,,,,
units = cells/mL,,,,,,
,,,,,,
HPLC Samples,,,,,,
"Samples collected same as POC, PON, and influx; HPLC run by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Ocean Ecology Laboratory",,,,,,
Collected duplicate filters every 5-8 samples; NASA ran duplicate injections of several samples,,,,,,
Calculated averages when duplicate filters or injections were done,,,,,,
units = ug/L,,,,,,
